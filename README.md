# Pipoca Player

Pipoca Player is an extensible media player for the web.

## Current Status

Pipoca is yet to be born. For now, it only exists in our imagination.

## Goals

Pipoca must have the most popular features out of the box, and it must be super easy to setup. Also, Pipoca must have a super duper hyper ultra mega simple API and documentation, for developers to easily change and extend its behavior.

### Must-have Built-in Features

- HLS playback
- Quality Selector
- Watermark

### Desirable Features

- Dash playback
- Flash HLS playback (shoud we?) for old browsers support
- Multitrack SRT subtitles
- Playlists
- Video Ads (pre, mid and post roll)
- Image Ads
- Chromecast
- 360 Video Support
